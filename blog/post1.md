title: My first blog post
---

This is my first blog post which uses *mkaestatic*!

I am in a subdirectory and the relative URLs work like charm! Look at my source code. All this is automatically generated by mkaestatic.

Example:

Here is the [readme](/readme.html) and there is another blog-post [blog](/blog/post2.html).

Markdown code of the last line:

    Here is the [readme](/readme.html) and there is another blog-post [blog](/blog/post2.html)

HTML code:

    <p>Here is the <a href="../readme.html">readme</a> and there is another blog-post <a href="post2.html">blog</a>.</p>

The URLs are translated to the respective relative scheme.
